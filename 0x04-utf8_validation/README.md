## Key Concepts 📚

### Bitwise Operations in Python 🔍
- **Bitwise Operations**: Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), shifts (`<<`, `>>`).
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Bitwise Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme 🌐
- **UTF-8 Encoding Rules**: Familiarity with how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
- **Patterns**: Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
- **Resources**:
  - [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
  - [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

### Data Representation 💾
- **Byte-Level Data**: How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
- **LSB Handling**: Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### List Manipulation in Python 📋
- **List Operations**: Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### Boolean Logic 🔑
- **Logical Operations**: Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.

## Additional Resource 💡
- [Mock Technical Interview](https://interviewing.io/)

## Requirements ✅

### General 🛠️
- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **System**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3).
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang**: The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- **Style Guide**: Your code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x).
- **Executables**: All your files must be executable.

By studying the concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project. This involves effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.

Happy coding! 🚀
