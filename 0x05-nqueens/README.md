# 0x05. N Queens

## Overview

The **0x05. N Queens** project is a classic algorithmic problem in computer science and mathematics. It involves placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This project will help you understand and implement the backtracking algorithm, a key technique in solving combinatorial problems. 


### Backtracking Algorithms
- **Backtracking** is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems by incrementally building candidates to the solutions and abandoning a candidate ("backtracking") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

### Recursion
- **Recursion** involves functions calling themselves to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
